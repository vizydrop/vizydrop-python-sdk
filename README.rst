Vizydrop SDK for Python
=======================

This project provides a Python package that makes it easy to develop a third-party application integration with
Vizydrop.  The SDK provides everything necessary for developers to integrate their own data sources with our data
visualization platform with minimal effort and only a few lines of code.

The SDK supports only Python 3.3 and greater.

The Vizydrop Python SDK can be installed via PyPI, the Python Package Index:
