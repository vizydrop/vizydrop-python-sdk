Vizydrop SDK for Python
=======================

This project provides a Python package that makes it easy to develop a third-party application integration with
Vizydrop.  The SDK provides everything necessary for developers to integrate their own data sources with our data
visualization platform with minimal effort and only a few lines of code.

The SDK supports only Python 3.3 and greater.


Installation
============

Download Package
----------------

The Vizydrop Python SDK can be installed via PyPI, the Python Package Index:

.. code:: shell

    pip install vizydrop-sdk


Download Source Code
--------------------

Alternately, you can get the latest development source code for the SDK by using **git**:

.. code:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/vizydrop/vizydrop-python-sdk
    cd vizydrop-python-sdk
    python setup.py install
