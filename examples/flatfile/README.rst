Vizydrop `flatfile` Example
===========================

This example reads files out of the `data` directory and serves their information to Vizydrop.  While this example does
not provide any examples on authentication or developing a source schema, it does show you how to create a basic
integration with Vizydrop and how to leverage the dynamic `get_options` for filters.
