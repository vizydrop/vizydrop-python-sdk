============================

To help you get started with integrating your systems, platforms, and applications with Vizydrop, the Python SDK
package provides a few examples of varying use cases.  You can use these examples as a template to start developing
your own integrations.

The SDK supports only Python 3.3 and greater.

Vizydrop.  This example includes no authentication and does not provide a source schema.
